This works just the same, only a little different.  Rather than generate thumbnails along-side the images, it bakes them into the index.html pages, at a slight additional cost in storage, but very conveniently for having some tidy place to keep them all.

The tool cooks up EXIF data, and generates GPS links (if present) for the images.  

Click the little thumbnails, see big image at top of page.  Click big image, it collapses to just the thumbnails.

This is beta quality, and there are going to be bugs, for a bit.

  * [...] Pick a path.
  * [*] Open path in your OS' file browser.
  * [â™«] Checkbox enable 'ding dong' at end.
  * Thumbnail size Sets how big the thumbnails will be.
  * Columns sets how many columns across, per row of thumbnails.

It builds just like the other project.  I probably need to make a way to export the html templates, so it's easier to customize the appearance and behavior of what this spits out.
